## About The Project

![product-screenshot](https://github.com/Whogivsachit/Simple-GameServer-HomePage/blob/main/images/Example.png?raw=true)

This serves as a central hub for game servers, providing easy navigation to different pages and showcasing essential information about your staff and servers. We offer two versions of our website: static and dynamic.

__Please note:__ I don't offer any support for this repo do with it as you please credit would be appreciated though!

__The static version__ of our website is built with simple HTML. It provides a straightforward interface where you can explore various pages and access the information you need. While the static version doesn't pull information from a remote API, it still offers a reliable and user-friendly browsing experience.

On the other hand, __The dynamic version__ takes your experience a step further. It dynamically retrieves and displays information from a remote API, ensuring that the content is always up-to-date. This version is perfect if you're looking for real-time updates on staff and server details, allowing you to stay informed and connected.
